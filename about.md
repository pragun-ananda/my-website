title: About Me
---

I’m a software engineer at Google building machine learning infrastructure to store and retrieve the internet’s embeddings. Our team's infra is used by most recommendation systems at Google (ex: Search, Youtube, Lens, Research, etc.). I'm also working as a research engineer on the Cloud AI Research team on a project that uses LLM explainability scoring for long-document retrieval. From a career perspective, I’m very interested in applied AI research and building scalable ML infrastructure. Please don’t hesitate to shoot me an **[email](mailto:pragun.ananda@gmail.com)** if you'd like to chat!


Some links that might be of interest are my **[resume](/assets/pragun-resume.pdf)**, my **[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pragun-ananda/)**, and my **[github](https://github.com/pragun-ananda)**.


On a personal note, some of my favorite things to do are:
1. **Dancing** - I love bollywood and salsa, but I'm trying to get into hip-hop right now
2. **Discovering new music** - I probably have too many spotify playlists
3. **Binging a good book or show** - I'm currently watching Breaking Bad

I'm also trying to learn how to speak Kannada and sing, but I'm bad at both so they are not my favorite things to do right now.
