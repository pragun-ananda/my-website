title: About Me
---

I’m a software engineer at Google building machine learning infrastructure to store and retrieve the world’s embeddings. Our team's infra is used by most recommendation systems at Google (ex: Search, Youtube, Lens, Research, etc.). I'm also working as a research engineer on the Cloud AI Research team on a project that uses LLM explainability scoring for long-document retrieval. I’m very interested in applied AI research and building scalable ML infrastructure. Please don’t hesitate to shoot me an **[email](mailto:pragun.ananda@gmail.com)** if you'd like to chat!
