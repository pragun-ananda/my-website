I’m a software engineer at Google building machine learning infrastructure to store and retrieve the world’s embeddings. I also work on LLM interpretability research with use cases in information retrieval. I’m very interested in AI research and building ML infrastructure. Please don’t hesitate to shoot me an **[email](mailto:pragun.ananda@gmail.com)** if you'd like to chat!
