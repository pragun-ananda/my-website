title: About Me
---

I’m a software engineer at Google building machine learning infrastructure to store and retrieve the internet’s embeddings. Our team's infra is used by most recommendation systems at Google (ex: Search, Youtube, Lens, Research, etc.). I'm also working as a research engineer on the Cloud AI Research team on a project that uses LLM explainability scoring for long-document retrieval. I teach ML classes at Google when I can and I'm pursuing my masters in AI at UT Austin part-time. From a career perspective, I'm interested in challenging opportunities in AI research and infrastructure.
