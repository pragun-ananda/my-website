title: About Me
---

I’m a software engineer at Google building machine learning infrastructure to store and retrieve the internet’s embeddings. Our team's infra is used by most recommendation systems at Google (ex: Search, Youtube, Lens, Research, etc.). I'm also working as a research engineer on the Cloud AI Research team on a project that uses LLM explainability scoring for long-document retrieval. I teach ML classes at Google when I can and I'm pursuing my masters in AI at UT Austin part-time. From a career perspective, I'm interested in opportunities in AI research/infrastructure. If you'd like to chat, please don't hesitate to shoot me an **[email](mailto:pragun.ananda@gmail.com)**!


Some professional links that might be of interest are my **[resume](/assets/pragun-resume.pdf)**, my **[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pragun-ananda/)**, and my **[github](https://github.com/pragun-ananda)**.


On a personal note, some of my favorite things to do in my free time are:
1. **Dancing** - I love bollywood and salsa, but I'm trying to get into hip-hop right now
2. **Discovering new music** - I probably have too many [spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/22w3m2cfmodof4gyzocdlxr3q?si=fb26cb6576ce4c0d)
3. **Binging a good book or show** - I'm currently watching Breaking Bad and looking for my next book on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/178072352-pragun-ananda).

I'm also trying to learn how to speak Kannada and sing, but I'm bad at both so they are not my favorite things to do.
